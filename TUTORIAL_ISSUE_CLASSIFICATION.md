# Setting Up `issue_classification.yml` for GitHub Workflows

Welcome to the tutorial on setting up and understanding the `issue_classification.yml` workflow for GitHub repositories. This guide is designed for beginners (level 100) and aims to provide a comprehensive overview of how to utilize GitHub Actions to classify issues automatically.

## Introduction to GitHub Actions and Workflows

GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipelines directly within your GitHub repository. Workflows are custom automated processes that you can set up in your repository to build, test, deploy, or manage your project.

## Understanding `issue_classification.yml`

The `issue_classification.yml` workflow is a GitHub Actions workflow designed to classify issues as they are opened or edited within a repository. It can automatically label issues based on their content, making issue triage easier and more efficient.

## Setting Up the Workflow

To set up the `issue_classification.yml` workflow in your GitHub repository, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your GitHub repository.
2. Click on the "Actions" tab.
3. Click on "New workflow".
4. Scroll down to "set up a workflow yourself" and click on it.
5. In the editor that opens, paste the content of the `issue_classification.yml` workflow.
6. Commit the new workflow by clicking on "Start commit" and then "Commit new file".

## Customizing the Workflow

The `issue_classification.yml` workflow can be customized to fit the needs of your project. Here are some examples of how you can customize it:

- **Modify the issue labels**: You can change the labels applied by the workflow by editing the `labels` field in the workflow file.
- **Change the trigger events**: By default, the workflow triggers on issue creation and editing. You can modify the `on` section to trigger the workflow for different events.
- **Update the classification script**: The workflow uses a Python script to classify issues. You can update this script to change the classification logic.

## Conclusion

Setting up the `issue_classification.yml` workflow in your GitHub repository can significantly streamline the issue triage process. By customizing the workflow, you can tailor it to meet the specific needs of your project. We hope this tutorial has provided you with a solid foundation to get started with GitHub Actions and workflows.
